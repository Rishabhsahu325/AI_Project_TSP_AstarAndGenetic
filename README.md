#Problem Statement
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
a) Study and solve it using minimum-spanning-tree (MST) heuristic. 
b) Find and implement an efficient algorithm in the literature for constructing the
MST, and use it with A* graph search to solve TSP.
c) Study and report current state of the art methods which show (significant)
improvement over MST heuristic.

#Brief description
We solved this problem by applying A star search on MST heuristic generated from Prim's algorithm 
and compared the performance after solving it through genetic algorithm
